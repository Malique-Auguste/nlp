### Training Error
For the first 5 epochs of the leanring algorithim:
- The average training error (tr) decreased exponentially with increases in alpha.
- The average testing error (te) increaed logarithmically with increases in alpha.

This would suggest that as alpha increases, the nn tends to overfit the data
